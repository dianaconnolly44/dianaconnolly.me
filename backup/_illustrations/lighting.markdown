This illustration was completed as a study of lighting and color palettes, choosing different colors in the same image to denote warm verses cool lighting situations.

  <div class="small-12 medium-8 large-8 small-centered columns">

  </div>

I began by coloring the image with a warm color palette. Then, after drawing the shadow line, I changed the colors to the left of that line to be the original colors' cool counterparts, adding in blues and purples and slightly desaturing the hue. This was to give the portrait the sense that this girl was stepping into a warm pool of sunlight.
