As a graphic artist intern at Tobii Dynavox, I progressed from producing symbols to producing children's books. This is one of my first books I worked on for their Boardmaker Instructional Solutions unit, following the illustration style of one of the full time graphic artists. I developed my own children's book illustration styles in future assignments.
