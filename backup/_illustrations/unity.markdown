This series of images was created as a study of how colors interact with one another. The goal was to explore a unified color palette, and then add in a color that was an anomaly. Then, given this anomaly, I tried to bridge the color palette back together, to make the anomaly color fit in more with the original image.

<div class="row">

  <div class="small-12 medium-4 large-4 columns">
    <img src="/img/unity.png" alt="Hero Image">
    <p class="centered">Unified</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="small-12 medium-4 large-4 columns">
    <img src="/img/anomaly.png" alt="Hero Image">
    <p class="centered">Anomaly</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="small-12 medium-4 large-4 columns">
    <img src="/img/bridge.png" alt="Hero Image">
    <p class="centered">Bridge</p>
  </div>

This was an interesting experiment, because as my intentions were to make the anomaly color be the red lips introduced in the second image, the introduction of this warm color almost made the blues of her eyes seem more piercing than they had in the unified color palette. Perhaps because adding in red pushed the color palette to the warm side, making the skin, hair, and background feel less cold. However, the blue eyes remained as one of the cooler colors in the palette, and thus ended up feeling more piercing. To counteract this, I bridged the warm and cool palettes by adding in more warm colors to the final image.
