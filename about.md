        Hi! My name is Diana Connolly, and I’m a graphic artist currently living in the Steel City: Pittsburgh, PA.
        </p>

        <p>
        I received a dual degree in Cognitive Neuroscience and Art from Carnegie Mellon University this past spring, and am very passionate about using my art for the sake of benefitting others — such as illustrations for education or communication. 
        </p>

        <p>
        My interdisciplinary studies were fueled by my interest in how a viewer perceives a visual, and I am currently interested in how to make the most effective visuals. As Degas put it, “art is not what you see, but what you make others see.”
