        Diana is an illustrator and animator in New York City with special interest in using her art to aid education and communication, especially for young audiences or those with disabilities.
        </p>

        <p>
        She has experience in the health industry, creating children's books to explain medical conditions, animations to convey medical concepts, symbols and visual schedules to supplement social interactions for individuals on the Autism Spectrum, and communication symbols for nonverbal individuals to use on their speech generating devices. 
        </p>

        <p>
        She received a dual degree in Cognitive Neuroscience and Art from Carnegie Mellon University in 2017, and is passionate about visual perception and how to make the most effective visuals. As Degas put it, “art is not what you see, but what you make others see.”
