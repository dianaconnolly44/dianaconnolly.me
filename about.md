        Hi! My name is Diana Connolly, and I’m a graphic artist currently living in the ’Steel City’ — Pittsburgh, PA.
        </p>

        <p>
        I received a dual degree in Cognitive Neuroscience and Fine Arts from Carnegie Mellon University this past spring. I am interested in the cross between these two areas of study, particularly in learning how to create the most effective visuals for a specific message one wishes to communicate to an audience. As Degas put it, “Art is not what you see, but what you make others see.”
        </p>

        <p>
        I am currently searching for positions that would fit my interests, especially to further explore the use of visuals to communicate or teach certain messages.
