        Hi! My name is Diana Connolly, and I’m a graphic artist currently living in the Steel City — Pittsburgh, PA.
        </p>

        <p>
        I received a dual degree in Cognitive Neuroscience and Art from Carnegie Mellon University this past spring. I am very passionate about using art for the sake of benefiting others, such as using illustrations for teaching or storytelling purposes. My interdisciplinary studies were fueled by my interest in how a viewer perceives a visual, and I am currently interested in how to make the most effective visuals for a given message to be conveyed. As Degas put it, “art is not what you see, but what you make others see.”
        </p>

        <p>
        I am currently searching for positions that would fit my interests, especially to further explore the use of graphic arts to convey a desired message.
