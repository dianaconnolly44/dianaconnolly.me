I created the below educational children’s book this summer as my final assignment as Graphic Artist Intern at Tobii Dynavox. The assignment was to create a children’s book for our Boardmaker Instructional Solutions unit about the life of artist Frida Kahlo, done in a painterly illustration style - in honor of Kahlo’s paintings. I employed different brush effects in Adobe Illustrator to create this painterly effect, as well as using a color palette similar to those Kahlo used in her own works.
