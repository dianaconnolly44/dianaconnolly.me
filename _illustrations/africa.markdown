I created the below symbols as part of the "Thinline" set of communication symbols for Tobii Dynavox. Communication symbols like these are used by individuals who are unable to verbally communicate. The symbols are displayed to the user on an Augmentative and Alternative Communication device that can communicate for the user (such as the one Stephen Hawking uses). These specific sets of symbols are made to represent different kinds of terrains in various countries, as part of an educational program from Tobii Dynavox. The symbols are also placed on maps of each country, to give the viewer a sense of where they might find these terrains.
