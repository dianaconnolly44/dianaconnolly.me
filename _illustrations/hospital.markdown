As a Graphic Artist Intern, I created the below symbols for Tobii Dynavox, following their style guidlines (e.g. the 'egg head') to create my assigned list of hospital-related words. These specific symbols are part of the "Classic" line of communication symbols. Communication symbols like these are used by individuals who are unable to verbally communicate. The symbols are displayed to the user on an Augmentative and Alternative Communication device that can communicate for the user (such as the one Stephen Hawking uses). One would use these symbols if they were in the hospital, and needed to communicate how they werre feeling or requests they had for the hospital staff.
