<div class="row">

  <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-6 columns">
    <img src="/img/unity.png" alt="Hero Image">
  </div>

</div>

The above image was aimed to create a unified color palette.

<div class="row">

  <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-6 columns">
    <img src="/img/anomaly.png" alt="Hero Image">
  </div>

</div>
The above image was aimed to add in an anomaly to the originally uniform color palette.

<div class="row">

  <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-6 columns">
    <img src="/img/bridge.png" alt="Hero Image">
  </div>

</div>
And the final image was aimed at bridging the anomaly with the initial color palette, to make the anomaly color fit in more.
