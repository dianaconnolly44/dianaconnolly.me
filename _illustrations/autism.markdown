***This project is currently in progress, and is my senior capstone project for Carnegie Mellon University.***

I am partnering with Pittsburgh's Temple Sinai to create visual aids for their monthly Autism and sensory friendly Shabbat services. I met with the rabbis to discuss how best to represent each prayer in symbol form. Below are my current prayer symbols.

For the Shabbat service, I created fold-out bookmarks to go in people's prayer books. The bookmarks folded out to look like this:

These bookmarks were paired with a sticker packet of color versions of the symbols, to have the individual place the current prayer's sticker on top of its spot in the bookmark. This is to help people follow the prayer service.

I also created a large banner with the schedule of prayers printed in symbol form, to further help maintain engagement in following the service.
