This flipbook was made as a communication tool to explain Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). I got CRPS myself after a foot injury, and it took months to figure out exactly what was happening to my foot. A flipbook like this would have helped me, as a patient, to understand the mechanisms of CRPS.
