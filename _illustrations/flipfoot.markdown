This flipbook was made as a communication tool to explain Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), a chronic and localized pain syndrome that causes abnormal inflammation and nerve dysfunction. I developed CRPS myself after a foot injury, and it took months to figure out exactly what was happening to my foot. A flipbook like this would have helped me, as a patient, to understand the mechanisms of CRPS and know that the changes I was seeing in my foot were completely normal for CRPS patients.
